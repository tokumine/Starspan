traverser/    Observer-based processing mechanism.
              This is the core of the starspan library.
            
starspan.h    Declaration of main operations.
            
starspan2.cc  Contains the main() function.

starspan_csv.cc           CSV creation
starspan_dump.cc          for geometry visualization
starspan_gen_envisl.cc    Envi standard/spectral library creation
starspan_jtstest.cc       JTS test suit creation
starspan_minirasters.cc   miniraster creation
starspan_stats.cc         Basic statistics
starspan_update_csv.cc    update table in csv format        
starspan_util.cc          misc supporting utilities

Interfaces aimed to have some abstraction on raster and
vector objects: 
	vector/       Vector interface implemented on OGR
	raster/       Raster interface implemented on GDAL

jts/        JTS_TestGenerator: generates a test suite suitable for
            the JTS Test runner


Previous approaches for the starspan tool:
	java/         Geotools/JTS based approach: quite interesting but
	              limitations in format support made me decide for
				  a GDAL/OGR/GEOS approach.
	polygon/      tests on CGAL
	libtests/     basic library tests

	starspan1.cc  preliminary version of the tool.
